Over two-weeks, the travelers worked with the community members and CeCEP to complete construction of the twenty-two final systems. They conducted a variety of water quality tests at all previously-implemented EWB-USA WPI systems and many pre-existing systems from other past projects. The team held interviews with all families that received a system during this implementation trip to collect baseline data about water usage and habits. Further interviews were held with past beneficiaries to evaluate impacts and monitor system function. All systems were completed by teams of community members working alongside an EWB-USA WPI member and a facilitator/translator from CeCEP.",

On this trip, the team verified the home designs and the MOUs for the remaining 24 homes in Guachtuq that were planned to be implemented on with May. For further preparation, the team visited local construction stores to obtain quotes for the estimated list of materials needed for May 2015. The team also assessed the 12 homes EWB-USA WPI previously implemented with by talking with the families about the performance of the system in successfully of providing water security. Additionally, the team conducted water quality tests on each of the EWB-USA WPI rainwater harvesting systems. The team was encouraged that learning sessions on the May 2015 Implementation trip were successful based on the understanding that the community members have for system maintenance. Each family displayed adequate knowledge about cleaning the storage tanks, gutters, first flush units, and sediment filter at the faucet. During this trip, the team assessed a previously implemented EWB-USA WPI rainwater harvesting system that was moved and rebuilt by the family. This demonstrates that there has been sufficient knowledge transfer to the families that worked with EWB-USA WPI during the May 2014 Implementation trip. The knowledge base about the construction of rainwater harvesting systems among the community members is vital to the success of the May 2015 implementation trip.",

            "description": "Our sixth trip to Guachtuq was incredibly successful. Our team of seven students, one professor, and one professional mentor built rainwater harvesting systems with eight families in the community, updated existing systems with new innovations, assessed the remaining twenty-five homes (which will receive systems over the next two years), conducted extensive water quality tests on existing systems, boiled water, and Finca water, updated census data, and interviewed every family in the community. It was an impressive amount of work for a two-week trip! With the eight systems we implemented, we brought water to the midwife of the community, the president of the community government, a woman whose husband works six hours away for fifteen days at a time, a widow, and some of the happiest children in the world. Water quality tests confirmed that the “first flush,” a mechanism to divert initial water that washes dirt off the roof from contaminating the storage tanks, helps keep tank water cleaner. Tests also clarified that boiling water for as little as one minute kills coliform and E. coli bacteria. Interviews revealed interesting connections and dynamics within the community, illuminating the complexity of water security as a social issue. Throughout the trip, we strengthened relationships with community members, with CeCEP, the local NGO that supports us, and the local Municipality. Perhaps most importantly, we signed contracts with all of the remaining families in the community. We will bring water to at least fourteen families by May, 2015, and the remaining families by May 2016.",

These tests helped us to better understand existing water quality conditions in the community and ensure the safety of our rainwater harvesting systems. We were able to conclude that while our tank water was the safest option for the community, it still required boiling to absolutely prevent illness. To ease the construction process in May, additional plans were made with the eight families to receive systems to create concrete bases for the tanks and to meet roof square footage requirements prior to team arrival.",

With the community, we established the Guachtuq Water Committee to facilitate the organization and responsibilities of the community during implementation and for the long-term success of the project. We then developed an official Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Guachtuq Water Committee which carefully outlines EWB-USA WPI’s commitment to the project, and the community’s responsibilities in the joint effort. Relations with CeCEP were strengthened, in part with the continuation of the monitoring system. Additionally, pilot tank overflow issues were addressed and resolved, and inventories and bulk order quotes from local hardware stores were recorded in preparation for future trips.",

<h1>Bringing Water to Guatemala</h1>
<p style='font-style:italic;'>Engineers Without Borders-USA Worcester Polytechnic Institute (EWB-USA WPI) conducted a monitoring trip from May 7-23, 2016. The trip involved assessment of 34 rainwater harvesting systems which were previously implemented in the community within Water Supply Project 6871. Additionally, EWB-USA WPI ran an extensive certification program to educate community members in regards to maintenance and repair of the systems, helped community members make necessary repairs to their systems, and conducted water quality tests and analysis. 
</p>
<p style='font-style:italic;'>The May 2016 Monitoring and Evaluation Trip focused on three major goals: (1) to empower community members to independently operate and maintain the rainwater harvesting systems through a training and certification program; (2) to make minor system adjustments for the purpose of improving water quality, quantity, and access; and (3) to ascertain whether the community’s goals have been met through continued project monitoring with water quality tests, interviews, system inspections, and focus groups. </p>
	<p style='font-style:italic;'>The program began in 2009 when EWB-USA WPI partnered with Guachtuq, a community that expressed lack of water security as a pressing problem. Prior to the project, community members gathered water from the finca, a large water basin located on private property at the bottom of the community. The Water Supply Project is the only open project in the Guachtuq program. EWB-USA WPI has partnered with the local NGO, CeCEP, which provides cultural information, translators, work space, and communication with the community when the team is not in Guatemala. EWB-USA WPI identified individual rainwater harvesting systems as the most technologically and culturally appropriate solution to the problem. Following identification of this solution, EWB-USA WPI worked with community members to build systems with 34 families. The first two systems in the community were built in January 2013. In January 2014, the systems built in 2013 were modified, and two more systems were constructed. In May 2014, eight additional systems were built. To finish the implementation phase, 22 systems were constructed in May 2015. Since the final implementation, a team from CeCEP has  visited the community every two weeks to monitor the systems, updating  EWB-USA WPI on status of systems and problems that arise in the community.
</p>
	<p style='font-style:italic;'>EWB-USA WPI is entering a six-month monitoring period to ensure that  the community can sustain the systems independently. In this monitoring period, EWB-USA WPI will be sending an associate of CECEP, Edghar Gua, into the community to continue gathering data on the physical state of the systems. CeCEP will remain active in the community, continuing to uphold the MOUs signed with community members. CeCEP has agreed to mediate any conflicts or difficulties with maintaining MOUs in the community in conjunction with the CoCODE. The monitoring data will be used to help the club determine if the project objectives were met. If the club determines that the objectives have been met, then the club will close the project at the end of the monitoring period.  If it is determined that this is not the case, then EWB-USA WPI intends to pass the project to another chapter  due to our university’s new travel restrictions to Guatemala.

	<h2>Water Supply - Guachtuq Guatemala</h2>
	<table>
		<tr>
        	<td>
The rural community of Guachtuq, located in the mountainous Alta Verapaz region of Guatemala, is one of many worldwide that lack water security. During the dry season, February to May, the community relies solely on the “finca,” a polluted, spring-fed water collection basin. While the Finca is located on public land, the water source originates on private property, and access is tenuous. Though the community is currently allowed to use the water, most members walk over an hour, multiple times a day, to collect water. Finca water is limited during the dry season, leaving the community lacking adequate quantities of water to meet basic needs. Water-quality testing has shown that the finca is contaminated with coliform and harmful E. coli, pathogens that can cause illnesses requiring medical attention. EWB-USA WPI seeks to provide a sustainable source of potable drinking water for all 220 members of Guachtuq and improve water security throughout the region.
<br /><br />
Currently, EWB-USA WPI is implementing personalized rainwater harvesting systems for each of the 36 homes in the community, an approach selected in response to social concerns and limited communal land. This solution will provide community members with reliable access to clean water year round. To supplement the harvesting system, the team is researching water treatment methods to further guarantee water security. After three assessment trips and three successful implementation trips, construction of rainwater harvesting systems for all families will be completed by May, 2016.

<h3>Implementation Trip: January 2015</h3>
<p style="width:100%;">
<p style="width:67%;float:left;">
During EWB-USA WPI’s seventh trip the team assessed the feasibility of the May 2015 Implementation trip. On this trip, the team verified the home designs and the MOUs for the remaining 24 homes in Guachtuq that were planned to be implemented on with May. For further preparation, the team visited local construction stores to obtain quotes for the estimated list of materials needed for May 2015. The team also assessed the 12 homes EWB-USA WPI previously implemented with by talking with the families about the performance of the system in successfully of providing water security. Additionally, the team conducted water quality tests on each of the EWB-USA WPI rainwater harvesting systems. The team was encouraged that learning sessions on the May 2015 Implementation trip were successful based on the understanding that the community members have for system maintenance. Each family displayed adequate knowledge about cleaning the storage tanks, gutters, first flush units, and sediment filter at the faucet. During this trip, the team assessed a previously implemented EWB-USA WPI rainwater harvesting system that was moved and rebuilt by the family. This demonstrates that there has been sufficient knowledge transfer to the families that worked with EWB-USA WPI during the May 2014 Implementation trip.  The knowledge base about the construction of rainwater harvesting systems among the community members is vital to the success of the May 2015 implementation trip.

<h3>Implementation Trip: May 2014</h3>
<p style="width:100%;">
<p style="width:67%;float:left;">Our sixth trip to Guachtuq was incredibly successful. Our team of seven students, one professor, and one professional mentor built rainwater harvesting systems with eight families in the community, updated existing systems with new innovations, assessed the remaining twenty-five homes (which will receive systems over the next two years), conducted extensive water quality tests on existing systems, boiled water, and Finca water, updated census data, and interviewed every family in the community. It was an impressive amount of work for a two-week trip! With the eight systems we implemented, we brought water to the midwife of the community, the president of the community government, a woman whose husband works six hours away for fifteen days at a time, a widow, and some of the happiest children in the world. Water quality tests confirmed that the “first flush,” a mechanism to divert initial water that washes dirt off the roof from contaminating the storage tanks, helps keep tank water cleaner. Tests also clarified that boiling water for as little as one minute kills coliform and E. coli bacteria. Interviews revealed interesting connections and dynamics within the community, illuminating the complexity of water security as a social issue. Throughout the trip, we strengthened relationships with community members, with CeCEP, the local NGO that supports us, and the local Municipality. Perhaps most importantly, we signed contracts with all of the remaining families in the community. We will bring water to at least fourteen families by May, 2015, and the remaining families by May 2016.

<h3>Implementation Trip: January 2014</h3>
<p style="width:100%;">
<p style="width:67%;float:left;">This trip to Guatemala involved updating existing rainwater catchment systems with first flush components and overflow valves, implementing two more rainwater harvesting systems, and conducting water quality tests. These tests helped us to better understand existing water quality conditions in the community and ensure the safety of our rainwater harvesting systems. We were able to conclude that while our tank water was the safest option for the community, it still required boiling to absolutely prevent illness. To ease the construction process in May, additional plans were made with the eight families to receive systems to create concrete bases for the tanks and to meet roof square footage requirements prior to team arrival.

<h3>Assessment Trip: May 2013</h3>
<p>During our fourth trip, EWB-USA WPI assessed the performance of our previously implemented rainwater harvesting systems and prepared for future implementation trips. Water quality tests were conducted to compare contaminants in the water from different available sources (government tanks, Finca, WPI tanks). With the community, we established the Guachtuq Water Committee to facilitate the organization and responsibilities of the community during implementation and for the long-term success of the project. We then developed an official Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Guachtuq Water Committee which carefully outlines EWB-USA WPI’s commitment to the project, and the community’s responsibilities in the joint effort. Relations with CeCEP were strengthened, in part with the continuation of the monitoring system. Additionally, pilot tank overflow issues were addressed and resolved, and inventories and bulk order quotes from local hardware stores were recorded in preparation for future trips.

<h3>Implementation Trip: Jan 2013</h3>
<p>On the third trip, EWB-USA WPI implemented two pilot rainwater harvesting systems and made future implementation preparations.  A monitoring system for the pilot homes was developed with CeCEP cultural museum, which supports the local community. A museum representative visits the community every two weeks and collects data about water usage and the effectiveness of the systems implemented, relaying the information through weekly Skype calls to our team. The system has been effective so far, and once analyzed, the data will be invaluable to determining what steps should be taken next in implementation and whether design improvements should be made.  We also reestablished the layout and location of the community homes in preparation for the next ten houses selected to receive rainwater harvesting systems.

<h3>Assessment Trip: July 2011</h3>
<p style="width:100%">
<p style="width:67%;float:left;">Before designing a solution to Guachtuq's water needs, EWB-USA WPI conducted a second trip to finalize individual home system plans, inventory available materials, perform water quality tests, and collect rainwater data. These assessments allowed us to develop deeper connections between our team and community members of Guachtuq. Detailed layouts and photos of each home were noted, and individual household water usage was well documented. We visited local hardware stores and evaluated prices to determine which materials were affordable and available to the community. These steps were essential to implementing our harvesting design. A rain gauge was also installed for further monitoring of rainfall data.

<h3>Assessment Trip: July 2010</h3>
<p style="width:100%;">
<p style="width:67%;float:left;">
Our first trip to Guachtuq assessed all proposed solutions to the problem (well, rainwater, pre-existing community tanks, etc.). We also tested the quality of available water and established connections within the community. We collaborated with a geologist at the University of San Carlos, who provided information about the geology and rainfall data for the area. Assessment of the physical layout of the community also started during this trip.

        The rural community of Guachtuq, Guatemala, is one of many worldwide that struggles to deal with <i>water poverty</i>. Water poverty, like food poverty, energy poverty, and poverty of other resources, including education, is a lack of sufficient resources to meet needs. In contrast, <i>water security</i> can be described as having adequate <b>quantity</b>, <b>quality</b>, and <b>access</b> to water for cooking, drinking, bathing, washing clothes and dishes, agriculture, etc. In 2009, when EWB-USA WPI began working in Guatemala, the people of Guachtuq identified water poverty as their greatest concern.

        Guachtuq is a rural community of about 220 people (34 families), located on the outskirts of the San Cristobal Verapaz Municipality in the Alta Verapaz department of Guatemala, a mountainous region in the center of the country. Many community members exclusively speak Pokomchi, an indigenous Mayan language, though some are proficient or fluent in Spanish. During the dry season, late January through mid-May, the community historically has relied on a single communal water basin, colloquially called the <i>finca</i>, located near the bottom of the community. Women and children often spend 4-6 hours collecting water every day, walking up and down the steep slope carrying plastic jugs and baskets of laundry. While the finca is located on public land, the water source originates on private property, and access is tenuous. Socio-economic tensions and questions of ownership frequently arise. Though the community is currently allowed to use the water, this precious resource is limited, especially during the dry season when the community is left lacking adequate quantities of water to meet basic needs. To make matters worse, water-quality testing has shown that the finca is contaminated with coliform and harmful <i>E. coli</i>, pathogens that can cause illnesses requiring medical attention.

        EWB-USA WPI aims to provide the families of Guachtuq with water security. <b>The goal of this project is to ensure that each family in Guachtuq has adequate quantity, quality, and access to water to meet cooking and drinking needs year round.</b> To achieve this goal and mitigate water poverty in Guachtuq, EWB-USA WPI has worked with the community members to develop and implement individual rainwater harvesting systems at each of the 34 homes.

        Rainwater harvesting systems, sometimes referred to as <i>rooftop rainwater harvesting systems or rain collection systems</i> in literature, capture rain that falls on the roof of a building and store the water in large tanks or cisterns. In EWB-USA WPI’s Guachtuq Rainwater Harvesting project, systems are designed to collect rain that falls on the roof of a family’s home and store the water in large plastic tanks, providing water for cooking and drinking year round. Individual rainwater harvesting systems are considered the most technologically and culturally appropriate solution due to a variety of factors, including geology, community layout, local culture, personal finances and the informal nature of community membership. To supplement the harvesting systems, the team is researching water treatment methods to further guarantee water security.

        After three assessment trips and four successful implementation trips, construction of rainwater harvesting systems for all families culminated in May, 2015, when the team build the final 22 systems in the community. Over the years, EWB-USA WPI developed a relationship with El Centro Comunitario Educativo Pokomchi (CeCEP), a non-governmental and non-profit organization that provides the team with cultural information, translators, a workspace, and communication with the community when the team is not in Guatemala. To ensure long-term success, the EWB-USA WPI team developed educational materials and trainings to teach families how to use, maintain, and repair systems. The team will make a final journey to Guachtuq in May, 2016, to monitor system function and evaluate project impacts.

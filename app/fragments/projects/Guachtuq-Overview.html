The rural community of Guachtuq, located in the mountainous Alta Verapaz region of Guatemala, is one of many worldwide that lack water security. During the dry season, February to May, the community relies solely on the “finca,” a polluted, spring-fed water collection basin. While the Finca is located on public land, the water source originates on private property, and access is tenuous. Though the community is currently allowed to use the water, most members walk over an hour, multiple times a day, to collect water. Finca water is limited during the dry season, leaving the community lacking adequate quantities of water to meet basic needs. Water-quality testing has shown that the finca is contaminated with coliform and harmful E. coli, pathogens that can cause illnesses requiring medical attention. EWB-USA WPI seeks to provide a sustainable source of potable drinking water for all 220 members of Guachtuq and improve water security throughout the region.
<br /><br />
Currently, EWB-USA WPI is implementing personalized rainwater harvesting systems for each of the 36 homes in the community, an approach selected in response to social concerns and limited communal land. This solution will provide community members with reliable access to clean water year round. To supplement the harvesting system, the team is researching water treatment methods to further guarantee water security. After three assessment trips and three successful implementation trips, construction of rainwater harvesting systems for all families will be completed by May, 2016.

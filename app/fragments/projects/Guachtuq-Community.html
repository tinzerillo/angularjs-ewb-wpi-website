	<h1>Guachtuq, Guatemala - Community</h1>
    <p>
    
        Guachtuq is a rural community of about 220 people, located on the outskirts of the San Cristobal Verapaz Municipality in the Alta Verapaz department of Guatemala, a mountainous region in the center of the country. Many community members exclusively speak Pokomchi, an indigenous Mayan language, though some are proficient or fluent in Spanish. Thirty-four families live dispersed over 1 km on a dirt road that leads up a mountain; there is approximately a 500 ft elevation difference over the length of the community. During the dry season, January through April, the community historically has relied on a single communal water basin, colloquially called the finca, located near the bottom of the community. Women and children often spend 4-6 hours collecting water each day, walking up and down the steep slope with containers and baskets of laundry. Socio-economic tensions and questions of ownership frequently surround use of the finca water. The water originates on a nearby private farm and, though the basin was built in 2006 through an agreement between the farm owner and the community, members of other communities sometimes make use of the finca as well.
